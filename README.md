# Sandfly Credentials Adapter

The Sandfly Credentials Adapter is an implementation of the Sandfly [external credential provider interface](https://support.sandflysecurity.com/support/solutions/articles/72000594533-external-credential-provider-interface). When Sandfly develops interfaces to third-party credential vault products, they are added to this adapter.
